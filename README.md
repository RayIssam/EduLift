AI-Powered Teacher Assistant

problem statment 
Teachers spend a significant amount of time on administrative tasks such as grading, lesson planning, and providing feedback while trying to track student progress. This leaves them with less time to focus on personalized teaching, mentoring, and engaging with students on an individual level. As a result, the quality of education and student success may be impacted.

How AI Benefits Teachers
- Time-Saving : Automates grading and report generation.
- Reduced Workload : Frees up time for lesson planning and individualized teaching.

- Increased Efficiency : Provides insights for real-time adjustments in teaching.

Technical Process 
We used Microsoft Copilot Studio as the core of this project. Initially, we explored Azure Machine Learning (ML) for deeper student performance analysis, but due to technical limitations, we pivoted to Copilot AI for real-time analytics and recommendations.

üí° However, we strongly believe that in future iterations, training the AI model on real student performance data will lead to more accurate and personalized insights for teachers.

Understanding the Dataset
Our dataset consists of 20 features that influence student performance, grouped into three main categories. Behavioral & Study Factors include metrics such as Hours_Studied, Attendance, Sleep_Hours, Previous_Scores, Motivation_Level, Tutoring_Sessions, and Physical_Activity, which directly impact a student's learning habits and academic engagement. Parental & Socioeconomic Factors cover aspects like Parental_Involvement, Family_Income, and Parental_Education_Level, reflecting the role of family background in academic success. School & External Factors account for elements such as Teacher_Quality, School_Type, Peer_Influence, and Access_to_Resources, highlighting the broader educational environment. The target variable, Exam_Score, represents the final exam performance, serving as the key measure of student outcomes.
